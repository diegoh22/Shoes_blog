# Typography
The fonts were obtained from Google Fonts.

For my logo text I have used Pacifico.

For the heading text I have used Poppins.

For the main text I have selected Montserrat which complements the font used for my headings and logo.

I have avoided using overly stylised fonts, which can be difficult to read for users, therefore ensuring the website is more accessible to users with visual impairments.

In the event the font fails to load, I have used sans-serif as a back-up font.

## Imagery
Images are obtained from the google.

I have used imagery appropriate to the websiteâ€™s content to provide a more visual experience to the user.

Please see further details in the Credits section for the specific images used within the project.

# Database
A relational database was used for this project.

During production SQLite/Postgres was used as the main database, and for deployment all data was migrated to Heroku Postgres.

Please note that for testing purposes SQLite database was used. In the settings.py code was added to allow for the databases to be swtiched between SQLite for testing and Postgres for regular production. When DEVELOPMENT = True, then the SQLite database will be used for testing, and when this is set to False, then the Postgres database will be in use.

# alidation Testing
## To test the HTML code, I used the W3C Markup Validation Service.


![apture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83575427/183723488-30772a6f-d371-4ef3-8e49-0c0ee4e30bdb.JPG)


- Please note that the base.html has been validated as part of the above pages as the code was inclusive of the testing.

## To test the CSS code, I used the W3C CSS Validation Service.

##style.css:


- No errors were detected in the code.

To test the JavaScript code, I used the JSHint Validation Service.

##script.js:


#The following HTML files were tested with script code:

add_post.html
edit_post.html
No errors were detected in the code. Warnings were detected in the code however this was due to the use of the new ES6 syntax in the code.

To test the Python code, I used the PEP8 Online Validation Service.

All files passed through the validator and no issues were detected with the exception of the settings.py file. This was due to the rows in question being too long, however as these are auto generated by Django or the link name being too long these rows were not amended and left as they are.

I also used the Chrome Dev Tools Lighthouse Report to test both on desktop and mobile.

The score for the lighthouse report for desktop and mobile run across the different pages varied from 77 lowest to 100 highest. Further steps were taken to try to improve the score, however no major score changes could be achieved for the report.

#This website was tested on the following browsers:

Google Chrome
Safari
Mozilla Firefox
This website was also tested on the following devices:

iPhone 11 Pro
iPhone 12 Pro
iPad Pro
MacBook Air
Android One Plus 8 Pro
Automated Testing
Further testing was completed importing the Django TestCase. The test files can be located in the blog > tests folder for the project, this consists of the following files:

test_forms.py
test_models.py
test_urls.py
test_views.py
Please note that for testing purposes SQLite database was used. In the settings.py code was added to allow for the databases to be swtiched between SQLite for testing and Postgres for regular production. When DEVELOPMENT = True, then the SQLite database will be used for testing, and when this is set to False, then the Postgres database will be in use.

The Coverage was used to assist with automated testing to check the percentage of the project code that was covered with automated testing. The test provided an overall coverage of 76%.

To generate your own coverage report:

Install the package using pip install coverage
Run coverage run manage.py test
Then coverage html to generate the report
The report can be viewed in a browser by opening the index.html file from inside the htmlcov folder
The remaining untested code was tested manually for this project as detailed in the above sections.

In addition to completing automated testing for this project, the Travis CI for Continuous Integration was used to further test. However, due to changes with the Travis CI policy the free package was no longer accessible, therefore full testing could not be completed as expected.

# Deployment
The project was developed using GitPod and was deployed via the GitHub repository to Heroku.

The following steps were followed to deploy this project:

From the Heroku dashboard, select 'New' in the top right-hand corner.
Click 'Create new app'.
Enter the app name and choose region as Europe.
Click 'Create app'.
Select the 'Settings' tab, and scroll down to 'Buildpacks'.
Add 'Python' and save changes.
Scroll down to 'Config Vars' section, and add the 'KEY' and 'VALUE' for the CLOUDINARY_URL, DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY to run the app.
At the top of the page, click on the 'Deploy' section.
Select Github as deployment method.
Select 'Connect to Github', and locate the repository name and click on 'Connect' to link my Heroku app to my Github repository code.
To add the Postgres Database, click on the 'Resources' tab.
Under Add-ons, search for 'Heroku Postgres', click on the search result for this.
Select the 'Hobby Dev-Free' option and click submit order form which will add this to the Add-ons section.
Scroll further down, select 'Enable Automatic Deploys' and then select 'Deploy Branch' to deploy project.
After it has successfully deployed a 'view' button appears on screen and when clicked opens the deployed application.
Run the command heroku login -i and login when prompted. Then run the following command: heroku git:remote -a your_app_name_here and replace your_app_name_here with the name of your Heroku app. This will link the app to your Gitpod terminal.
After linking your app to your workspace, you can then deploy new versions of the app by running the command git push heroku main and your app will be deployed to Heroku.
